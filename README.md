Changelog
Changes Implemented Since Part 2
Moved menu item adding/removal to a dedicated screen for chefs.

Home screen now displays average price for each course.

Added filter page for guests. Guests can filter menu to see only Starters, Mains, or Desserts.

All menu items are saved in an array and updated in real time.

Removal feature added for both chef and homepage displays.

Refactoring for Final PoE
Extracted reusable functions (e.g., for computing averages, filtering, and core logic) to a shared utility file (utils.ts).

Split all screens into separate files (HomeScreen.tsx, AddMenuItemScreen.tsx, FilterScreen.tsx, etc).

Applied for, while, and for-in loops in data transformation and UI logic:

for loop: Calculating average prices by course on the home screen.

while loop: Used for bulk removal operations (if multiple items are selected for deletion).

for-in loop: Listing out properties for a menu item object.

Defined global variables (app state/context) for courses and menu items, shared across screens.

Improved code organization and readability by separating components, hooks, and helpers.
